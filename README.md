**Cardiovascular_Disease_Detection**

Author: Andrei Kuzmin


Goal: goal was creating a reliable model, which allows to detect the subject having cardiovascular disease, and as bonus goal, to also find out whether it is possible to get a good result with reduced amount of required data, to allow testing oneself with that data one could get at home alone.


Repository content: init.csv - initial dataset(allowed by license), tests.ipynb - the notebook which contains the way initial data was processed, all the models and grids tested, including final model and tests for reduces data. 


Steps to get the result: by running the tests.ipynb one will get the results based on which it is possible to decide efficency of different models, as for exact values in the models, they were gotten either bu grid, if so this is also awailable to find in the notebook, or by manual tuning, where I basically changed  some parameters and lookes how it chaged the scores.
